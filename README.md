# **Luna** - Group project 

----
## Project specifications

### Docker integration

- Project can be developed inside a docker container.
- Docker container has SSH access during development.
- PyCharm can access the container python environment with a remote ssh interpreter.
- PyCharm can run management commands with the _manage.py_ file inside the container.

### Testing

- Your code gets tested on **gitlab** every time you make a new commit.
- Every endpoint has at least one or more tests executed when you run `$ python manage.py test`.
- Tests are having a master test class that has basic functionality implemented.
- Tests cover not only success but also error messages that are expected from the API.
- Tests cover also if a user has not rights to change or update data in the database. (test for right error messages).

### Permissions

- Implement object based permission check with the `GenericAPIView` or by calling `self.check_object_permissions(self.request, obj)` yourself inside the view where ever it's needed.
- Add `DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES` to make sure every endpoint needs an authentication without declearing it every time.

### Clean code

- Run `flake8` tests every time you commit on the **gitlab** runner server to make sure your stick to the PEP8 standard.
- Make sure you structure your code enought that every file is not lager than 100-200 lines.
- Keep your imports clean and short by using file imports instead of direct imports of classes and definitions.

### Documentation

- Activate the built-in docs package to make sure your API's can be viewed in a browser and have meaningfull documentation: [DRF custom documentation][drf-custom-docs]
- Make some good comment for each of your views so they get displayed in the docs frontend. (blockcomments - docstrings)

### Authentication

Implement a **JWT authentication** for DRF with this package: [JWT Authentication for DRF][jwt-auth].
